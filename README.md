# Check your favorite artist's(band's) most popular song availiable markets!

With help of this Django-app you can check your favorite artist's(band's) most popular song availiable markets. To start, visit http://kostya1408.pythonanywhere.com/.

This application based on the SpotifyAPI. So, at the start page you can type the name of artist(band), and if it is in SpotifyAPI, you'll have first the page, that will inform you, what song is it searching to and then the result(the map with countries in red and green colors). So, for example, you want to check out availiable markets for the most popular Eminem's song.

To begin, let's type eminem in search field:
